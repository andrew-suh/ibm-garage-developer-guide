This is often refereed to as **Day 2 Developer Experience**. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the Garage Method its important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably to `test` and then onto `production`. A good understand of common **Day 2** activities is a critical skill for cloud native development teams.\n\nThis weeks homework involves a number of tasks that are more advanced that week from week 1, so the advice is take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\nThis homework assumes that you have:\n - Reviewed the **Playback** from the Week 2 Monday session\n - Seen a demo of each of the homework tasks below\n - Seen demos and discussion about what is expected from the homework\n\nPlease make sure you have reinstalled the latests version of the [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](/getting-started/cli)\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: Support is provided in the `#catalyst-project` Slack channel (in the [IBM Garage for Cloud Slack Org](http://ibm-garage.slack.com) team).\nThis channel will also be used to share any common issues found.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n**Week 2** is focused on Day 2 developer experience. This term is used to refer to the tasks that an agile team will perform to help manage, operate and delivery their software to test and production.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Read through the Developer Guide| There have been updates from the first week focus on Tools Guides for the homework below and the guides for Inventory Micro App Part 1 and 2 | [Developer Guide](/overview) | 30 min |\n| Review your Image Registry | Using the Image Registry Guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section |[Image Registry](/guides/image-registry#give-it-a-try) | 15 mins |\n| Review your app Code Quality | Using Sonar Guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section |[Sonar Registry](/guides/code-analysis#give-it-a-try) | 30 mins |\n| Viewing  your app Logs | Using LogDNA Guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section | [LogDNA Guide](/guides/log-management#give-it-a-try) | 20 min |\n| Monitor your app | Using SysDig Guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section | [SysDig Guide](/guides/monitoring#give-it-a-try) | 30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App,Part 2 | Deploying your Inventory UI, BFF , SVC apps to `test` namespace using GitOps Continuous Delivery and ArgoCD  | [Inventory Part 2 - CD](/practical/inventory-part2#using-cd-to-deliver-to-test) | 45 min |\n| Inventory Micro App,Part 2 | Secure your Inventory App | [Inventory Part 2 - Secure App](/practical/inventory-part2#securing-the-solution-with-app-id) | 30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App,Part 2 | Adding Cloud Database to you Inventory Service | [Inventory Part 2 - Database](/practical/inventory-part2#add-a-cloudant-integration-to-your-backend-service) | 45 min |\n| Install Dev tools on CRC | Install and configure Garage Developer Tools into Red Hat CodeReady Containers | [Install CRC](/admin/installation-crc) | 1 hr |\n\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks you will have completed the homework for the **Day 1** Developer Experience, which enabled you to create your first app and CI pipeline.

It will have a description of tasks tht didnt go so well, It will close with a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks.
