Enrollment will enable you to be added to the development environment on the IBM Cloud.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Notification\n\nAfter the first live webcast has completed, you will receive an email giving you details on how to access the Developer Tools environment for your development team. The email will specify the MOOC Sandbox Registration Details:\n- **Account**: This is the IBM Cloud account with a Developer Tools environment for your team and resources to perform the homework\n- **Team name**: This is the name of your development team, such as `mooc-team-one`, `mooc-team-two`,`mooc-team-n..`\n- **Git Organization**: This is the GitHub org for your team's set of git repos\n- **Resource Group**: This is the IBM Cloud resource group for your Developer Tools environment\n\nYou must associate your IBM email address with your public GitHub account or make sure you have a public account that is using your IBM email address.\n- Go to [Github](https://github.com)\n- Log into your account or create one\n- Navigate to you account settings\n- Select emails, check your IBM email address is your primary email for the account\n- If it is not then add you IBM email and verify it\n- If you are correctly verified and associated you will receive a second email inviting you to your associated git organizations\n\n![GitHub eMail](githubemail.png)\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you do not associate your IBM email with you public GitHub account, you will have issues completing the homework.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nThe Sandbox has been defined exactly how a client would use the IBM Cloud. Each development team will contain up to 30 of your Garage colleagues. Each team has been configured in [IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam) as its own access group with a corresponding resource group. Your resources for your team's Developer Tools environment has been created in that resource group. So as a member of your team's access group, you'll have access to the resources in your team's Developer Tools environment. Since the Developer Tools environment has already been created, you will be restricted from creating new cloud resources or deleting existing ones.\n\nThe following teams diagram helps to explain how access will be configured. Imagine you are the Green user: There will be lots of other users in your team, maybe in different timezones, all sharing the same cloud resources. The administrators will monitor the cluster to identify any issues early and resolve them.\n\n![MOOC Teams](moocteams.png)\n\nYou will be given access to the team's GitHub organization. You will be expected to create all of your Git projects as repositories in your team's organization. This is how real world development projects work. This will enable you to collaborate with your fellow team members and will prevent you from creating duplicate projects names.\n\n**Extra credit**: After performing the homework in the OpenShift cluster, can you get it working in a Kubernetes cluster as well? As shown in the teams diagram above, your team's Developer Tools environment and its resource group include not only an OpenShift cluster but also a Kubernetes cluster. It's helpful if you can perform these development tasks in both container platforms because some Garage clients use one and some use the other. If you can work in both, you'll be qualified to staff more projects. The Developer Tools environment makes the developer experience the same for both container platforms.\n\n<p/>\n\n## Team Locations\n\nThe teams are spread globally in different geographic locations listed below.
