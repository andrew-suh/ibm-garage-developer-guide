It lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.\n\nTekton provides open-source components to help you standardize your CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. Industry specifications around pipelines, releases, workflows, and other CI/CD components available with Tekton will work well with existing CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Jenkins X, Skaffold, and Knative, among others.\n\nFor more information read up about it [here](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/knative-build-app-development-with-tekton/)\n\nThe IBM Cloud is standardizing on using Tekton in both IBM Cloud DevOps service and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. OpenShift 4.2 will also natively support it.\n\nThis guide will focus on using Tekton when the Development tools have been installed along side IBM Cloud Pak for Applications to compliment your cloud native development toolset.\n\n\n\n### Tasks\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This guide will help you setup the `Starter Kit Templates` with  **Tekton* and requires that you have installed Tekton with **IBM Cloud Pak for Applications* , **OpenShift 4.2** or have installed open source Tekton into the The IBM Kubernetes Cluster.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\nThe following gives a description of what each task in a the pipeline does. The *Optional* stages can be deleted or ignored if the tool support it is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a Cloud Native application.\n\n- **Setup** clones the code into the pipeline\n- **Build** runs the build commands for the code\n- **Test**\tvalidates the unit tests for the code\n- **Publish pacts**\t(*optional*) publishes any pact contracts that have been defined\n- **Verify pact** (*optional*) verifies the pact contracts\n- **Sonar scan** (*optional*) runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube\n- **Build image** Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry\n- **Deploy to DEV env**\tDeploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart\n- **Health Check** Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application\n- **Package Helm Chart** (*optional*) Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart into Artifactory\n- **Trigger CD Pipeline** (*optional*) This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**\n\n### Setup Tekton\n\n- Install [Red Hard Code Ready Containers](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/content/ibm-cp-applications\n) on the OpenShift Cluster from the IBM Cloud Catalog\n\n- Install [IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools](/admin/overview) on your managed OpenShift development cluster on the IBM Cloud\n\n- Clone the **Tekton Tasks** onto your development machine\n    ```base\n    git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks.git\n    cd ibm-garage-tekton-tasks\n    ```\n- Install the Tasks into the `dev` namespace\n    ```base\n    kubectl apply -f ibm-garage-iteration-zero/tekton -n dev\n    ```\n- Using the **Starter Kit Template** of your choice install the _Pipeline_ into your `dev` namespace.
