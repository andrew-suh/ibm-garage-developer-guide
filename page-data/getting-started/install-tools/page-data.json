The container will \n    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and \n    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running \n    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.\n\n    ```bash\n    % ./launch.sh\n    Cleaning up old container: ibm-garage-cli-tools-abcde\n    Initializing container ibm-garage-cli-tools-abcde from garagecatalyst/ibm-garage-cli-tools:0.0.24\n    d14e378eac5f8080dbaf5466d680396fc36f9fcf9433247409ea9b3a62326ad2\n    Attaching to running container...\n        ________  __  ___   ________                __   ______\n       /  _/ __ )/  |/  /  / ____/ /___  __  ______/ /  / ____/___ __________ _____ ____\n       / // __  / /|_/ /  / /   / / __ \\/ / / / __  /  / / __/ __ `/ ___/ __ `/ __ `/ _ \\\n     _/ // /_/ / /  / /  / /___/ / /_/ / /_/ / /_/ /  / /_/ / /_/ / /  / /_/ / /_/ /  __/\n    /___/_____/_/  /_/   \\____/_/\\____/\\__,_/\\__,_/   \\____/\\__,_/_/   \\__,_/\\__, /\\___/\n                                                                            /____/\n    Run 'image-help' to get a list of available tools, scripts, and ENV properties\n    ```\n\n    The `image-help` command shows what can be done in this conatiner:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ image-help\n    Available env properties (can be overridden for individual commands):\n    > BM_API_KEY - the IBM Cloud api key\n    > REGION - the IBM Cloud region (e.g. us-south)\n    > RESOURCE_GROUP - the IBM Cloud resource group\n    > CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud\n    > SL_USERNAME - the Classic Infrastructure user name or API user name (e.g. 282165_joe@us.ibm.com)\n    > SL_API_KEY - the Classic Infrastructure api key\n\n    Available tools:\n    > terraform (with helm, kube, and ibm provider plugins)\n    > calicoctl\n    > ibmcloud (with container-service, container-registry, and cloud-databases plugins)\n    > kubectl\n    > kustomize\n    > oc\n    > helm\n    > docker\n    > git\n    > nvm\n    > node (v11.12.0 currently installed)\n    > yo\n\n    Available scripts:\n    > init.sh {BM_API_KEY} {REGION} {RESOURCE_GROUP} {CLUSTER_NAME}\n    > createNamespaces.sh\n    > deleteNamespace.sh\n    > installHelm.sh\n    > cluster-pull-secret-apply.sh\n    > setup-namespace-pull-secrets.sh\n    > checkPodRunning.sh\n    > copy-secret-to-namespace.sh\n    ```\n\n- Install the Developer Tools\n\n    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in `terraform.tfvars`. \n    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.\n\n    Run this script in the container:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will install the Developer Tools into the cluster.\n\n    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed.

At the end, you should have your Developer Tools environment \n    fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!\n\n### Developer Tools environment\n\nOnce the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created.\n\nTo see this in IBM Cloud:\n- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview \"Managing resources in the resource list\")\n- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `catalyst-team`)\n- You should see these resources listed:\n    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift\n    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.\n    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage\n- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:\n    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`\n    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `catalyst-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.\n\n### Possible issues\n\nIf you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. \nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:\n- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)\n- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n```bash\nrm -rf workspace\n./runTerraform.sh\n```\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"77746e9d3d2c0a14ec1efd24fa7fd58c","counter":235,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install Developer Tools"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Install Developer Tools\n---\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Pre-requisites\">\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nPrepare to run the scripts that create a cluster\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThe IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools facilitate development and deployment of cloud-native applications. \nThey can be hosted in any Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\nOnce that cluster is created, follow these instructions \nthat explain how to access, configure, and run the scripts to install the Developer Tools into the cluster.\n\nThe following pre-requisties are required before following the setup instructions.\n\n- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running on your local machine\n- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"1.
